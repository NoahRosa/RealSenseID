Realsense ID version 0.18.1
-----------------------------------
Added missing 3rd party files
Add option to enable metadata in windows installer

Realsense ID version 0.18.0
-----------------------------------
* New device config options to support multiple faces and algo options:
    * FaceSelectionPolicy:
        * Single (default, authenticate closest face).
        * All (authenticate all detected faces (up to 5)).
    * AlgoFlow:        
        * All (default).
        * FaceDetectionOnly.
        * SpoofOnly. 
        * RecognitionOnly.
    
* Preview improvements:
    * Added MJPEG @ 1080p and 720p streams.
    * Added an option to display and save RAW10 images of the selected frame.
    * UVC metadata support (e.g. timestamp info) - please refer to the README for additional information on how to enable this feature on Windows.

 * Authentication loop - automatically stopped even if the host exits without cancelling.


Realsense ID version 0.17.1
--------------------------
Fixed preview resource cleanup in windows

Realsense ID version 0.17.0
--------------------------
* Database import/export support [Device mode only]:
  'rsid-viewer' contains 2 new buttons, when in 'Device Mode' - one will export the database from the device to a json file, the other will import a json compatible file to device and save it.
   Right now, usernames must be unique for this to work properly.
* Better face detection capabilities.
* Adaptive learning. Update the user's faceprints when new information can be learned, after a successful authentication attempt.
* Fixed device settings issue with 'advanced mode'.
* Fixed crash caused by trying to resume/pause preview while updating firmware.
* Fixed a crash caused by incorrect order of de-allocating resources.
* Advanced mode features enabled.
    * Run Spoof Detection - will return if the user is fake or not. Example can be found in 'rsid-viewer'.
    * Camera Dump Mode - get 1920x1080 RAW10 images from the device, instead of a live RGB preview stream.
